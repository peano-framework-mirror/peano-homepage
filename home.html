<h1>Peano - a Framework for Solvers on Spacetree Grids</h1>
<h2>www.peano-framework.org</h2>


<p>
Peano is an open source C++ solver framework. 
It is based upon the fact that spacetrees, a generalisation of the classical 
octree concept, yield a cascade of adaptive Cartesian grids. 
Consequently, any spacetree traversal is equivalent to an element-wise 
traversal of the hierarchy of the adaptive Cartesian grids. 
The software Peano realises such a grid traversal and storage algorithm, and 
it provides hook-in points for applications performing per-element, per-vertex, 
and so forth operations on the grid. 
It also provides interfaces for dynamic load balancing, sophisticated 
geometry representations, and so forth.
Some features are enlisted below.

<p>
While the software was originally written for matrix-free geometric multigrid 
solvers in computational fluid dynamics, it has meanwhile emancipated from this 
single purpose and became a general-purpose AMR grid management and traversal 
tool. 
Other groups use it for Lattice-Boltzmann or particle codes.

<h2>Copyright and Support</h2>
<p>
Peano is open source software primarily developed from 2009-2012 at Technische Universit&auml;t M&uuml;nchen,
and it is delivered as source code only. 
Its license is available on the Copyright page to your left. 
As support, there is a Peano developer list, but noone commits to give support.
For the maillist, visit <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/peano/mailman">the
mailman</a> and subscribe to the maillist <i>peano-framework@lists.sourceforge.net</i>.
For bug reports, please also register to the maillist and post your bug description to the 
Peano community.
If you need further information on Peano, please contact <a href="mailto:info@peano-framework.org">the info email</a>.
<p>
<p>
Most of the documentation is done directly in the source code, but there are 
some mini tutorials available in the project wiki. Also, the example applications
might be a good starting point to get familiar with Peano.
