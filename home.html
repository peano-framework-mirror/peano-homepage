<h1>Peano - a Framework for Solvers on Spacetree Grids</h1>
<h2>www.peano-framework.org</h2>


<p>
Peano is an open source C++ solver framework. 
It is based upon the fact that spacetrees, a generalisation of the classical 
octree concept, yield a cascade of adaptive Cartesian grids. 
Consequently, any spacetree traversal is equivalent to an element-wise 
traversal of the hierarchy of the adaptive Cartesian grids. 
The software Peano realises such a grid traversal and storage algorithm, and 
it provides hook-in points for applications performing per-element, per-vertex, 
and so forth operations on the grid. 
It also provides interfaces for dynamic load balancing, sophisticated 
geometry representations, and other features.
Some properties are enlisted below.

<p>
While the software was originally written for matrix-free geometric multigrid 
solvers in computational fluid dynamics, it has meanwhile emancipated from this 
single purpose and became a general-purpose AMR grid management and traversal 
tool. 
Other groups use it for Lattice-Boltzmann or particle codes.

Peano is open source software primarily developed from 2009-2012 at Technische Universit&auml;t M&uuml;nchen,
and it is delivered as source code only. 
Its license is available on the Copyright page to your left. 
As support, there is a Peano developer list, but noone commits to give support.

For bug reports, please also register to the maillist and post your bug description to the 
Peano community.
If you need further information on Peano, please contact <a href="mailto:info(at)peano-framework.org">the info email</a>.
</p>
<p>
Most of the documentation is done directly in the source code, but there are 
some mini tutorials available in the project wiki. Also, the example applications
might be a good starting point to get familiar with Peano.
