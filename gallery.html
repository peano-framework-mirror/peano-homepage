<h2>Multigrid solvers: BoxMG in Peano</h2>

<table><tr>
 <td><img src="gallery/boxmg-3d.png" /></td>
 <td>
<p>
 Together with Marion Weinzierl, I've submitted a paper
</p>
<pre>
 Marion Weinzierl, Tobias Weinzierl: Quasi-matrix-free hybrid multigrid on dynamically adaptive Cartesian grids. ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software
</pre>
<p>
 A preprint is available from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00648">arXiv</a>. 
 In the paper, we discuss various realisation idioms for multigrid that fuse ideas 
 of FAS, hierarchical generating systems, Galerkin coarse grid operator computations, 
 stencil compression and BoxMG determining problem-dependent inter-grid transfer operators.  
 It should be very straightforward to reconstruct the ideas from the paper at hands of a Peano download.
 However, I summarise the most important points/pitfalls here:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>The purely geometric multigrid solvers basically follow the Chapter 4.2 from the Peano cookbook.</li>
 <li>For the Galerkin and BoxMG part of the manuscript, we add an integer index to each vertex and make it point 
  to a PlainDoubleHeap entry. The stencils are stored on Peano's heap. See the class peano::heap::DoubleHeap for a 
  documentation.
 </li>
 <li>To compute Galerkin operators and the BoxMG operators from stencils stored within the vertex can be 
  tedious and error-prone. A similar reasoning holds for the computation of the stencils. Peano offers a 
  toolbox matrixfree that provides routines for this. See the download section or sourceforge. Notably, consult
  <ul>
   <li>matrixfree::stencil::StencilFactory for routines that yield standard FEM stencils for diffusion and convection operators.</li>
   <li>matrixfree::stencil::ElementMatrix for routines that allow you to extract from the 4/8 vertices of a cell the element stiffness matrices.</li>
   <li>matrixfree::solver::Multigrid for routines that accept prolongation, restriction and operator stencils and return the Galerkin coarse 
    grid operators. The class also provides dummies that make prolongation and restriction be d-linear operators.</li>
   <li>matrixfree::solver::BoxMG offers routines that accept the stencils of one fine grid patch as one large vector and return the BoxMG operators
    (or simple aggregation or injection).</li> 
  </ul>
  The classes and functions in the namespace matrixfree have been built with Peano in mind but they do not 
  directly use Peano for most routines. Instead, they rely on simple double vectors as input. As a result 
  you can also use them in different projects.
 </li>
</ul>

   You can read a preprint at <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.03954" target="_blank">arXiv</a>.
   A source code snapshot of the code used for the paper is available 
   <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/peano/files/demo-codes">here</a>. 
   Please note that this is a complete snapshot of 
   Peano with all of its glue code and the matrixfree toolbox which is a small 
   collection of routines I use for matrix free linear algebra. As it is a 
   snapshot, both Peano and its toolbox might be available as newer versions 
   today, and it might be reasonable to rewrite a solver from scratch if you 
   need one for a particular project. This snapshot is merely made available 
   as a documentation and to facilitate reproducability. Here are some 
   things to do if you work with the snapshot:
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>Download the code snapshot from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/peano/files/demo-codes">Peano's demo code section</a>.
   <li>Untar the archive with <pre>tar -xzvf helmholtz-snapshot.tar.gz</pre>.
   <li>Type in <pre>make</pre> which gives you a list of available build targets. You might have to update the makefile 
     however to adopt pathes or variables. For a quick start with the GNU compiler, try <pre>make gcc-release-dim2</li>
   <li>There is a script create-main-executables that builds (with Intel) all the executables used in the paper. There are 
     release and asserts variants, we have dimensions 2 through 7, there are vectorised (with pragmas) and not vectorised versions,
     and we have multichannel variants where the number of channels is set through the environment variable CHANNELS. 
     Not all possible combinations are currently provided through the makefile, but the extension of the file should be straightforward
     if you need additional targets.</li>
   <li>Once you have an executable at hand, run the code <pre>./peano-2d-gcc-release</pre> without any argument. It displays a usage 
     message. <pre>./peano-2d-gcc-release help</pre> yields more verbose output.</li>
   <li>A first experiment might be <pre>./peano-2d-gcc-release sin transition 0.7 0.1 0.01 yes no 100 101</pre>
     Our code writes binary legacy VTK files that you can open with Paraview or VisIt, e.g. The file sequence of
     interest in the first place is channel-0-finegrid*. The files hold one snapshot per iteration, i.e. you can 
     investigate the evolution of the adaptivity pattern.</li>
   <li>If you want to study the algorithm's implementation, the most interesting file should be helmholtz/mappings/AdditiveMultigridWithJacobi.cpp 
     and variants of this file.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   Compatibility remarks: We use some C++14 features in this code. Our tests with GCC 4.8.3 and GCC 4.9.1 have been successful, but we know 
   that older compiler versions (anthing older than 4.7) might face problems. So please ensure that you have an up-to-date translator version.

 This toolbox is also used in the <a href="http://www.exahype.eu">ExaHyPE</a> project.
 The shockbubble experiment above uses the 3D Euler solver of David Ketcheson as found in the Clawpack solver.
