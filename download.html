Peano is a C++ class collection used by Peano applications. Hence, download the 
kernel first before you test any application. For Peano developers, i.e. for 
researchers creating Peano applications from scratch, there is the 
Peano Development Toolkit (PDT), a small Java tool that is available here both 
as jar file and as source code. Besides the kernel and the toolkit with its 
sources, the Peano webpage also hosts a couple of example applications that are 
open to the public.

<p>
All files are hosted at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/peano/files">sourceforge.net</a>
and can be downloaded from this page. Alternatively, you may check out the data 
directly from the repository:
</p>
<pre>
svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/peano/code/trunk/kernel
</pre>
<p>
The PDT is available at 
</p>
<pre>
svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/peano/code/trunk/pdt
</pre>
<p>
It is based upon the tool <a href="http://www5.in.tum.de/dastgen" target="_blank">DaStGen</a>
embedded into the jar file. If you build the PDT yourself, you might have to download 
DaStGen's jar files separately.
